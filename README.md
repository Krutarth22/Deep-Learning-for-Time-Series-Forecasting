# Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting

The goal of this project is to understand how deep learning architecture like Long Short Term Memory networks can be leveraged to improve the forecast of multivariate econometric time series. In addition to compring LSTM's performance to traditional time series models like ARIMA and VAR, bayesian approaches are also explored.
